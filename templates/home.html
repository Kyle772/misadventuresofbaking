        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>My name is Rebecca, and I grew up watching my mom bake different types of cakes, and was fascinated by the art of baking even then. When I was old enough I was finally allowed to help in the kitchen. We used to make cake mixes, and her only recipe from scratch was pound cake, her specialty. As I grew older, I wondered what other items I could make from scratch. My mom wasn't too baking savvy and so I pursued this endeavor on my own. Soon I was baking cakes, custards, macarons, sugar cookies, and much more. I watched youtube videos I began perfecting my art. Now years later I may not be perfect, but I'm getting closer day by day. The kitchen is my home, and baking is my art. I bake desserts as well as food: roasted chicken, spinach dip, there isn't anything I don't try to do. The Misadventures of Baking blog began because I mess up a lot, but I succeed even more. No one baker/chef/culinary artist is the same, only through trial and error do we achieve the greatest success.
